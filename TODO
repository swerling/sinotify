1. Refactor Notifier and Event so that other operating systems can be used for prim events.

   Currently there are couplings between Event and PrimEvent that assume linux (easy to remove),
   and couplings between Notifier and PrimEvent that assume linux (harder to remove, will need
   an adapter class)

2. Batch collate events

   Currently if you remove or add a directory with lots of files, events are sent out for
   every single file. Would be nice option if a single event listing all the changes went
   out (say, a single event that sponges up all events for 150 milliseconds, then sends them
   off as an array)
